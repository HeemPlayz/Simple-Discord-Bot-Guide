# Simple-Discord-Bot-Guide

## 1st Step

You need a Folder For your Discord.js Bot
So we heed To `Desktop` Or to your `Host`
and Make a Folder Called `My First Bot` Or Any name you like.

## 2nd Step

We have to make sure There is a package file for our bot
So We make a file called `package.json`
And Put Inside
`https://pastebin.com/gBU05tdu`

## 3rd Step

Now to Coding Step
There are 2 Ways Of Making a Code Files
`1.` Standered Way
`2.` Handler Way

## Standered Way

Is to put your all codes in 1 file
called `index.js` or any name 
and there is a file Up called `index.js` You can check it out

## Handler Way

It is the most common way
and it is more organized that the `Standered Way`
There is a file called `handler.js`
but this file just to define the where commands are
so you will say only 1 code to define where commands are
and if you are using The `Handler Way`
You must make a Folder called `commands` or any name as you define what folder there are the commands
