# File Explaination 

## How To make Commands By This Way?

Well It is Suuuuuper `Easy`
Then How?

First You make a File called `AnyNameYouWant.js`
You HAVE To write the Requirments and that only is
`const Discord = require("discord.js")`

## Then 

You Write `module.exports.run = (client, message, args) => { Your Code Here }`

And then Between `{ }` You HAVE to Put Your code

## Finally

We put a code to know when will the code will be excuted
and there we write like `ping` and it replys `PONG MY BROTHER`
The Code is `module.exports.help = {
name: "ping"
}`
